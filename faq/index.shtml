				<h4 id="how-book-ep">How do I book Events Production?</h4>
					<p>Booking Events Production is incredibly easy! Once your space reservation has been confirmed through the <b><a>Office of Events Management</a></b>, fill out the <b><a href="bookingForm.html">booking form</a></b> online or call our offices at (703) 993-3773 and we’ll get the process started. Once we receive your request, one of our experienced staff members will create an estimate for our services which will be sent to your email within three days of your request. If you have any questions about the estimate please contact our offices and we’ll be happy to help you. Otherwise, once you have received the estimate you’re all set!</p>
				<h4 id="how-book-venue">How do I book a venue?</h4>
					<p>In order to host an event on the Fairfax Campus of George Mason University, you must first book a venue through the <a>Office of Events Management (OEM)</a>*. You can view space availability through the University’s scheduling system, <a href="http://scheduling.gmu.edu/25live/">25live</a>. Events Production cannot be booked for your event until a venue has been booked and confirmed with OEM.</p>

<p class="smallText"><b>*</b>Some venues are operated by specific services, such as Housing or Dining, which must be reserved directly through that entity.</p>
				<h4 id="how-book-ops">How do I book tables/chairs/staging?</h4>
					<p>Events Production has a large inventory of tables, chairs, and staging that can be included in your event package. These can be rented as a part of an A/V package or separately for outdoor events or events in non-Student Centers spaces. Events that take place inside of Student Centers spaces include tables, chairs, and staging at no additional cost. Please consult your reservation details in <a>25live</a> for further information of what is included in each event space.</p>
				<h4 id="laptop-requirements">What are the minimum requirements for using my laptop to project a presentation?</h4>
					<p>Events Production currently offers VGA connections for laptops and other media devices at all venues and portable setups. The ideal display resolution for these devices is 1024 X 728 or higher. HDMI connections are available in the Cinema at Johnson Center and in the Ballroom at the HUB. Clients may also reserve laptops through EP for a minimal charge.</p>

<p class="smallText"><b>*Mac Users:</b> EP does not carry the Mac adaptor for VGA output. These adaptors are available from the University Computer Store for a fee.</p>
				<h4 id="nonstaff-equipment">Can EP techs operate non-EP equipment or vice versa?</h4>
					<p>Events Production technicians are highly trained on our in-house and portable systems and are guaranteed to provide the best service possible using our gear. While we do allow the use of non-EP equipment at events, EP techs are not permitted to operate this equipment as they are not trained to deliver results with this gear at the same quality. By the same token, non-EP personnel are not permitted to operate EP equipment under any circumstances. If a technical package is booked for an event, an EP staff member will be assigned to operate the equipment at all times to ensure event quality in execution.</p>
				<h4 id="tech-staff-included">Does booking EP include a tech staff?</h4>
					<p> All technical rentals (audio/video/lighting) will be staffed by trained Events Production technicians. These technicians will take care of setup, operation, and strike of all booked equipment. Non-technical rentals such as tables and chairs will be staffed for setup and takedown, but no personnel will be present during your event.</p>
				<h4 id="provide-player-cinema">Do I have to provide my own player in the Cinema?</h4>
					<p>Enter Text Here</p>
				<h4 id="tech-staff-cinema">Do I need to book EP for my Cinema Event?</h4>
					<p>The Cinema comes equipped with in-house speakers, 2 wired microphones, and a laptop hookup to the projector which are included with the room reservation. Clients who are showing a movie in the Cinema and require the use of a VCR/DVD or BluRay player need to hire Events Production. The booth located at the back of the Cinema is locked at all times and will only be opened if an EP technician is present to operate the equipment. If you wish to use the VCR/DVD player or the Blu-Ray player, you will need to hire Events Production. However, movies and/or presentations that can be displayed on a client laptop may be projected in the Cinema without hiring EP, via the laptop hookup provided.</p>
				<h4 id="tech-staff-bistro">Do I need to Book EP for my Bistro Event?</h4>
					<p>The Bistro comes equipped with in-house speakers, 2 wired microphones, and a laptop hookup from the stage which are included with the room reservation. Clients are not allowed access to the booth at any time. The Bistro has a range of additional features installed such as LED lighting, VHS/DVD player, enhanced speaker system, which can be operated by EP technicians at your event. If you wish to upgrade your event with these features or book any of our portable equipment to enhance your event, you will need to book EP.</p>
				<h4 id="instrument-usage">Instrument usage?</h4>
					<p>Events Production currently does not provide any instruments or amps for client rental. However, we do have the proper equipment to support any band event, as long as the musicians provide their own instruments. The Johnson Center has an upright piano located outside of the Dance Studio that is available for use at events. If you would like to reserve the piano for your event, please notify Events Management, Note: EP does not provide piano tuning services. The Client is responsible for arranging piano tuning services.</p>
				<h4 id="lighting-options">What lighting options are available for my event?</h4>
					<p>Each venue in the Johnson Center and HUB is equipped with basic installed lighting systems controlled by switches on the wall. Venues such as the Bistro, Dewberry, and HUB Ballroom have upgradable lighting options available that can be booked through Events Production. In addition, we have portable lighting that can be used at any venue based upon availability including LED uplights, lasers, black lights, moving effect lights, and Haze FX. For specific information for your event, please fill out our booking form or give us a call.</p>
				<h4 id="sc-guidelines">Where can I find the policies/guidelines for Student Centers spaces?</h4>
					<p>All event policies and guidelines pertaining to Student Center’s venues may be found on the <a>Student Center’s website</a> or by <a>clicking here</a>. Please take a few moments to review these policies and guidelines before your event.</p>
				<h4 id="power-for-vendors">Can we reserve additional power and extension cords for vendors?</h4>
					<p>Additional power and extension cords for vendors, catering, and band equipment may be reserved through Events Production. We will do our best to accommodate your power needs based on your assigned venue and available equipment. Please indicate any power needs you anticipate for your event at the time of booking EP services.</p>
				<h4 id="outdoor-events">What do I need to know for my outdoor event?</h4>
					<p>When planning your next outdoor event, please consider the following details:<br>

<b><em>Power</em></b> – Is there enough power at your outdoor venue to accommodate what you have planned, or will you need <b>generators for your outdoor event</b>?<br>

<b><em>University Amplified Sound Policies</em></b> - Campus noise ordinances dictate specific restrictions on how long and loud sound can be played at outdoor events. Please review this policy in the SC event policies/guidelines.<br>

<b><em>Rain/Cancellation</em></b> - In the event that there is inclement weather during an outdoor event, precautions will be taken to protect equipment provided by Events Production. These precautions may include event setup adjustments, temporary shutdown of equipment, and in severe weather situations Events Production may be forced to cancel services. It is highly recommended that clients book an additional indoor space for their outdoor event in the case of inclement weather. If moved inside, Events Production will do their best to accommodate the desired needs for the event as best as possible.</p>
				<h4 id="changes-policy">Can I make any changes to my event?</h4>
					<p>After your event has concluded, Events Production will send an invoice via email. This invoice will reflect the final equipment and labor that was utilized, including any changes that occurred during the course of the event. Once the invoice has been received by the client, the organization number provided will be charged within three weeks. Please check this number on your invoices to ensure that the charges are being sent to the correct organization code. Off-Campus groups who do not have an organization number must provide payment in form of a check to be delivered within three weeks of receiving the invoice. Checks should be made out to Events Production. Please feel free to contact us with any questions regarding invoices or services provided.</p>
				<h4 id="billing-policy">How do I get billed for my event?</h4>
					<p>After your event has concluded, Events Production will send an invoice via email. This invoice will reflect the final equipment and labor that was utilized, including any changes that occurred during the course of the event. Once the invoice has been received by the client, the organization number provided will be charged within three weeks. Please check this number on your invoices to ensure that the charges are being sent to the correct organization code.

				<h4 id="cancelation-policies">What are the adverse weather/cancellation policies?</h4>
					<p>Enter Text Here</p>
				<h4 id="extension-policies">What are event start/end time extension policies?</h4>
					<p>EP requires that any changes to its services be made ten days prior to the event. If the start or end time of an event needs to be changed during the ten day period, we will do our best to accommodate based on staff and equipment availability but cannot guarantee coverage.<br>
If a client would like to extend the end time while the event is currently underway, the Events Production technician(s) working the event may be consulted. If the technician(s) are available to stay longer and the equipment is not assigned for another event, it may be possible to extend services. There will be additional labor charges for the extension that will be reflected in the invoice.<br>
If the technician(s) or equipment are not available for an extension, EP services will end as scheduled. No exceptions will be permitted.</p>
				<h4 id="are-we-djs">Does EP provide DJs?</h4>
					<p>EP does not provide DJ services. However, if you would like a source of music before, during, or after your event we have commercial-free Pandora Radio that can be provided at no extra charge. *We assume no responsibility for any content that is played on Pandora Radio on stations requested by the client.</p>
